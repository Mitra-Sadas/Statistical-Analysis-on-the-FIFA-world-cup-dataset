# Statistical-Analysis-on-the-FIFA-world-cup-dataset

The dataset consists of player information, which includes height, weight overall rating, potential etc. 
Data Cleaning and basic EDA process is performed.

a)	Assumed age as population, performed the central limit theorem with sample size of 200. Found the standard error and the mean of sampling distribution. 
Compared the results with population mean and standard deviation. 
Explained in non-technical terms why the estimated standard error of a sample mean tends to decrease with an increase in sample size.

b)	Provided evidence that the players overall rating is greater than 80.

c)	Performed the statistical test to identify whether preferred foot has any impact on potential. Also, performed the graphical analysis.

d)	Performed the statistical test to identify the relation between the overall rating and potential.

e)	Does skill move have any effect in overall rating? Perform the graphical analysis and the statistical analysis.
